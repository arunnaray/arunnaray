## 🌱 **What I'm Working On**
I'm currently focused on building **AI-driven platforms** that improve enterprise workflows using **Generative AI**, **Agentic AI**, and **Knowledge Graphs**. Here are some ongoing projects:

- **Agentic AI Mesh Framework:** A novel framework combining AI agents with knowledge graphs to dynamically optimize business processes in real-time.
- **AI Incident Categorization:** Enhancing IT service management by automating incident triage using advanced machine learning models for better issue resolution.
- **Knowledge Management Systems (KMS):** Creating AI-powered interfaces for seamless access to cross-platform data and insights, significantly reducing time-to-action for enterprise teams.

---

## 🚀 **Featured Projects**
### 1. **AI Incident Categorization**
   - A robust model that categorizes incidents across Windows, Mac, and VDI environments. Uses **BERT** for multi-class classification, providing custom, accurate categories to improve resolution time.
   - Technologies: **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**, **BERT**, **Kubernetes**.

### 2. **Generative AI Knowledge Management System**
   - Integrated Azure OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4.0) with Hybrid **RAG** (Dense & Sparse retrieval) for natural language querying across enterprise data sources like **SharePoint**, **Confluence**, and **GitHub**.
   - Result: Reduced data lookup time by 40% and increased self-service analytics adoption by 60%.

### 3. **AI-driven Employee Experience Analytics**
   - Developed an AI pipeline to analyze employee feedback, using sentiment analysis and NLP techniques to improve workplace culture and optimize employee well-being strategies.
